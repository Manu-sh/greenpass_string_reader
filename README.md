# greenpass string reader

Dependencies: [base45-ansi-C](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/base45-ansi-C.git), [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/), [COSE-C](https://github.com/cose-wg/COSE-C.git).

About **base45-ansi-C** it raise many warning because it make an signed integer overflow (which is **UB**)
i don't care for now, but it's important to know.

I started this to help a guy, then i have wasted hours trying to figure how to COSE-C should be used to this purpose, 
so i decided to publish here.
